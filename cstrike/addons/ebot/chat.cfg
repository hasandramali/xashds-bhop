@KEY "BOTMAN"
who is this botman everybody is talking about???
visit his website at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman

i wonder when HPB-Bot will be finished...
did you play his HPB-Bot yet?

@KEY " BOT ", "BOTS"
why are you always talking about them?
there are no bots on this server %s, I tell you!
bots are cool!!!

you should start playing with humans
most bots are still very stupid!

too many people online cheat in CS
its not as much fun as it used to be

@KEY " DOD ", "DAY OF DEFEAT"

cs all the way...
%s do you think it will get as popular as cs?

Day of Defeat is a hopeless MOD

@KEY " ENGINE "

JB? It was good back then but ParaBot is much better now

Rumours have it that The Fatal now does AHL Bots?
